quotes:
- Health care worker unions were associated with a 1.29-percentagepoint reduction
  in mortality, which represents a 30 percent relative decrease in the COVID-19 mortality
  rate compared with facilities without these unions. Unions were also associated
  with greater access to PPE, one mechanism that may link unions to lower COVID-19
  mortality rates.
- More than 40 percent of all reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths
  in the United States have occurred in nursing homes.
