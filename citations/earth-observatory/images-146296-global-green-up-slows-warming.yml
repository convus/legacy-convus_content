quotes:
- Scientists previously established that the world is greener than it was in the early
  1980s. Updated maps show that the trend has continued, and researchers say reduced
  global warming is among the consequences.
- "“It is ironic that the very same carbon emissions responsible for harmful changes
  to climate are also fertilizing plant growth,” said co-author Jarle Bjerke of the
  Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, “which in turn is somewhat moderating global
  warming.”"
