quotes:
- The breadth and often strength of biological impacts we reveal highlight the need
  for outdoor artificial night-time lighting to be limited to the places and forms—such
  as timing, intensity and spectrum—where it is genuinely required by the people using
  it to minimize ecological impacts.
- exposure to artificial light at night induces strong responses for physiological
  measures, daily activity patterns and life history traits.
- We found particularly strong responses with regards to hormone levels, the onset
  of daily activity in diurnal species and life history traits, such as the number
  of offspring, predation, cognition and seafinding (in turtles).
