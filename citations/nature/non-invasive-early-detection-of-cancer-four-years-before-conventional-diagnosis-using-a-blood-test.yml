quotes:
- 'We show that PanSeer detects five common types of cancer in 88% (95% CI: 80–93%)
  of post-diagnosis patients with a specificity of 96% (95% CI: 93–98%), We also demonstrate
  that PanSeer detects cancer in 95% (95% CI: 89–98%) of asymptomatic individuals
  who were later diagnosed, though future longitudinal studies are required to confirm
  this result. These results demonstrate that cancer can be non-invasively detected
  up to four years before current standard of care.'
