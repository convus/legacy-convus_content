quotes:
- This article brings a new perspective to the analysis of the wage effects of the
  Mariel boatlift crisis, in which an estimated 125,000 Cuban refugees migrated to
  Florida between April and October, 1980. The author revisits the question of wage
  impacts from such a supply shock
- Given that at least 60% of the Marielitos were high school dropouts, this article
  specifically examines the wage impact for this low-skill group. This analysis over-
  turns the prior finding that the Mariel boatlift did not affect Miamiâ€™s wage structure.
  The wage of high school dropouts in Miami dropped dramatically, by 10 to 30%
