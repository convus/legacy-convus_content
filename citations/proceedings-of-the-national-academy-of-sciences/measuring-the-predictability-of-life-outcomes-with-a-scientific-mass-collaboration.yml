quotes:
- Hundreds of researchers attempted to predict six life outcomes, such as a child’s
  grade point average and whether a family would be evicted from their home. These
  researchers used machine-learning methods optimized for prediction, and they drew
  on a vast dataset that was painstakingly collected by social scientists over 15
  y. However, no one made very accurate predictions. For policymakers considering
  using predictive models in settings such as criminal justice and child-protective
  services, these results raise a number of concerns.
- 160 teams built predictive models for six life outcomes using data from the Fragile
  Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a high-quality birth cohort study.
- For all outcomes, the distance between the most divergent submissions was less than
  the distance between the best submission and the truth
- Social scientists studying the life course must find a way to reconcile a widespread
  belief that understanding has been generated by these data—as demonstrated by more
  than 750 published journal articles using the Fragile Families data (10)—with the
  fact that the very same data could not yield accurate predictions of these important
  outcomes.
