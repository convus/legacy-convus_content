quotes:
- the preferences Harvard gives for recruited athletes, legacies, those on the deanâ€™s
  interest list, and children of faculty and staff (ALDCs). Among white admits, over
  43% are ALDC
- Among admits who are African American, Asian American, and Hispanic, the share is
  less than 16% each.
- Our model of admissions shows that roughly three quarters of white ALDC admits would
  have been rejected if they had been treated as white non-ALDCs.
- Removing preferences for athletes and legacies would significantly alter the racial
  distribution of admitted students, with the share of white admits falling and all
  other groups rising or remaining unchanged.
