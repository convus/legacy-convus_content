quotes:
- the preferences Harvard gives for recruited athletes, legacies, those on the dean’s
  interest list, and children of faculty and staff (ALDCs). Among white admits, over
  43% are ALDC. Among admits who are African American, Asian American, and Hispanic,
  the share is less than 16% each. Our model of admissions shows that roughly three
  quarters of white ALDC admits would have been rejected if they had been treated
  as white non-ALDCs.
- Removing preferences for athletes and legacies would significantly alter the racial
  distribution of admitted students, with the share of white admits falling and all
  other groups rising or remaining unchanged.
