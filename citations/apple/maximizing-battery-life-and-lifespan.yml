quotes:
- It’s especially important to avoid exposing your device to ambient temperatures
  higher than 95° F (35° C), which can permanently damage battery capacity. That is,
  your battery won’t power your device as long on a given charge. Charging the device
  in high ambient temperatures can damage it further.
