quotes:
- The RAV4â€™s base MSRP is around $2,250 lower than that of the hybrid, but the difference
  is only $850 if you get the nonhybrid version with all-wheel drive, which comes
  standard in the hybrid version. Given the discrepancy in fuel economy between the
  two SUVs (25/33 mpg for the all-wheel-drive nonhybrid RAV4 versus 41/38 mpg for
  the hybrid), it would take the average driver a little more than two years to make
  up the difference in cost.
- We named the RAV4 Hybrid our 2020 Best Car for the Money in the hybrid and electric
  SUV class.
