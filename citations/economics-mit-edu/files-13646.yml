quotes:
- I exploit exogenous variation in European immigration to US cities between 1910
  and 1930 induced by World War I and the Immigration Acts of the 1920s, and instrument
  immigrants' location decision relying on pre-existing settlement patterns.  Immigration
  increased natives' employment and occupational standing, and fostered industrial
  production and capital utilization.
