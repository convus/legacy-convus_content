quotes:
- If anything, a larger bias blind spot was associated with higher cognitive ability
- None of these bias blind spots were attenuated by measures of cognitive sophistication
  such as cognitive ability or thinking dispositions related to bias
- Being free of the bias blind spot does not help a person avoid the actual classic
  cognitive biases.
