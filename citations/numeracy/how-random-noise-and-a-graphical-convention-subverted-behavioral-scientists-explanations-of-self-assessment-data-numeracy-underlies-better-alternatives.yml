quotes:
- Much of the current consensus about peoples' inability to self-assess accurately
  comes from interpreting normative data presented in the Kruger-Dunning type graphical
  format or closely related (y - x) vs. (x) graphical conventions. Our data show that
  peoples' self-assessments of competence, in general, reflect a genuine competence
  that they can demonstrate.
