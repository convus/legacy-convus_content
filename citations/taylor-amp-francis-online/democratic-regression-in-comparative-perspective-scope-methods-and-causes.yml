- Between 1974 and 2005, a majority of states became democratic for the first time
  in history. However, a global democratic recession began in 2006 and has persisted
  – and deepened – over the past 14 years. Not only have average levels of freedom
  (or democratic quality) been declining globally and in most parts of the world,
  but the pace of democratic breakdown accelerated and the number of democratic transitions
  declined, particularly in the past five years. Democratic regression is particularly
  visible among the G-20 countries and other most populous and geopolitically weighty
  countries, 19 of which have declined in freedom during the democratic recession,
  with only two improving.
