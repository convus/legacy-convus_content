quotes:
- 'In Dr. Nuhfer’s own papers, which used both computer-generated data and results
  from actual people undergoing a science literacy test, his team disproved the claim
  that most people that are unskilled are unaware of it (“a small number are: we saw
  about 5-6% that fit that in our data”) and instead showed that both experts and
  novices underestimate and overestimate their skills with the same frequency. “It’s
  just that experts do that over a narrower range,” he wrote to me.'
