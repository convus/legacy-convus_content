quotes:
- On the dawn of repeal, the late Senator Paul Wellstone made an impassioned plea
  on the Senate floor. He said the repeal of Glass-Steagall would enable the creation
  of financial conglomerates which would be too big to fail. Furthermore, he believed
  that the regulatory structure would not be able to monitor the activities of these
  financial conglomerates and they would eventually fail due to engaging in excessively
  risky financial transactions. Ultimately, he said, prophetically, that the taxpayers
  would be forced to bail out these too-big-to fail financial institutions
