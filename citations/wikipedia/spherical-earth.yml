quotes:
- On a flat Earth, a Sun that shines in all directions would illuminate the entire
  surface at the same time, and all places would experience sunrise and sunset at
  the horizon at about the same time. With a spherical Earth, half the planet is in
  daylight at any given time and the other half experiences nighttime. When a given
  location on the spherical Earth is in sunlight, its antipode - the location exactly
  on the opposite side of the Earth - is in darkness.
- The Earth is massive enough that the pull of gravity maintains its roughly spherical
  shape. Most of its deviation from spherical stems from the centrifugal force caused
  by rotation around its north-south axis. This force deforms the sphere into an oblate
  ellipsoid
