quotes:
- The Mariel boatlift was a mass emigration of Cubans, who traveled from Cuba's Mariel
  Harbor to the United States between 15 April and 31 October 1980.
- Aside from the unemployment rate rising from 5.0 percent in April 1980 to 7.1 percent
  in July, the actual damage to the economy was marginal and followed trends across
  the United States at the time.
