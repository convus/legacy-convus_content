quotes:
- The Republican Party's campaign platform in the 2000 election called for "full implementation"
  of the Iraq Liberation Act and removal of Saddam Hussein; and key Bush advisers,
  including Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and Rumsfeld's
  Deputy Paul Wolfowitz, were longstanding advocates of invading Iraq, and contributed
  to a September 2000 report from the Project for the New American Century that argued
  for using an invasion of Iraq as a means for the US to "play a more permanent role
  in Gulf regional security..."
- The US government's belief that Iraq was developing Weapons of Mass Destruction
  (WMDs), was based upon documents which the CIA argued could not be trusted.
