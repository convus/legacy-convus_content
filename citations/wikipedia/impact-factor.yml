quotes:
- It is frequently used as a proxy for the relative importance of a journal within
  its field; journals with higher impact factors are often deemed to be more important
  than those with lower ones.
- Journal impact factors are often used to evaluate the merit of individual articles
  and individual researchers.
- Empirical evidence shows that the misuse of the JIF – and journal ranking metrics
  in general – has a number of negative consequences for the scholarly communication
  system. These include confusion between outreach of a journal and the quality of
  individual papers and insufficient coverage of social sciences and humanities as
  well as research outputs from across Latin America, Africa, and South-East Asia.
