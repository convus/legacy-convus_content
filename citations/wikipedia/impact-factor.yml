quotes:
- It is frequently used as a proxy for the relative importance of a journal within its field; journals with higher impact factors are often deemed to be more important than those with lower ones.
- Impact Factor is not a perfect tool to measure the quality of articles but there
  is nothing better and it has the advantage of already being in existence and is,
  therefore, a good technique for scientific evaluation.
