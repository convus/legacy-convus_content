quotes:
- Water at 16°C induced higher intake (6.4 ml/ kg) together with lower sweating (0.54
  ± 0.03 g), which can result in optimum level of hydration
- Sweating increased markedly just a few minutes after the onset of drinking.
- Drinking induces the recovery of thermoregulatory responses including sweating.
