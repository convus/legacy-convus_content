kind: original research
quotes:
- 'Journal impact factors depend on the research field: high impact factors are likely
  in journals covering large areas of basic research with a rapidly expanding but
  short lived literature that use many references per article'
- 'the journal cannot in any way be taken as representative of the article. Even if
  it could, the journal impact factor would still be far from being a quality indicator:
  citation impact is primarily a measure of scientific utility rather than of scientific
  quality, and authors’ selection of references is subject to strong biases unrelated
  to quality. For evaluation of scientific quality, there seems to be no alternative
  to qualified experts reading the publications.'
