quotes:
- 'Journal impact factors depend on the research field: high impact factors are likely
  in journals covering large areas of basic research with a rapidly expanding but
  short lived literature that use many references per article'
- 'the journal cannot in any way be taken as representative of the article. Even if
  it could, the journal impact factor would still be far from being a quality indicator:
  citation impact is primarily a measure of scientific utility rather than of scientific
  quality, and authorsâ€™ selection of references is subject to strong biases unrelated
  to quality. For evaluation of scientific quality, there seems to be no alternative
  to qualified experts reading the publications.'
