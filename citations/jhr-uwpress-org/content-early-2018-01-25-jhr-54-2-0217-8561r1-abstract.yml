quotes:
- This method improves on previous studies by choosing a control group of cities that
  best matches Miamiâ€™s labor market trends pre-Boatlift and providing more reliable
  inference. Using a sample of non-Cuban high-school dropouts we find no significant
  difference in the wages of workers in Miami relative to its control after 1980.
  We also show that by focusing on small sub-samples and matching the control group
  on a short pre-1979 series, as done in Borjas (2017), one can find large wage differences
  between Miami and control because of large measurement error.
