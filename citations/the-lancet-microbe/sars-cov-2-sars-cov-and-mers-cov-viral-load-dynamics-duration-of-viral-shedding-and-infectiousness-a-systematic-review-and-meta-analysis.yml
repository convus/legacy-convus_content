quotes:
- Maximum shedding duration was 83 days in the upper respiratory tract, 59 days in
  the lower respiratory tract, 126 days in stools, and 60 days in serum. Pooled mean
  SARS-CoV-2 shedding duration was positively associated with age (slope 0·304 [95%
  CI 0·115–0·493]; p=0·0016).  No study detected live virus beyond day 9 of illness,
  despite persistently high viral loads
