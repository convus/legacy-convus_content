- The flaw in the argument that an influx of workers will adversely affect native
  workers is in looking at people as if they are bananas, Clemens says. When the supply
  of bananas increases, the value of each individual banana falls. That isn't the
  case with humans, Clemens says, whose research shows that as more people arrive
  in a local economy, demand for goods and services such as housing and food also
  increases.
