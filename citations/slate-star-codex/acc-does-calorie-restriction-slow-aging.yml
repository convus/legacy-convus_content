quotes:
- None of the evidence in favor of CR is indisputable. CR-ROS, the hypothesis that
  calorie restriction reduces oxidative radicals, remains compelling, but direct evidence
  in humans is lacking. Numerous model animal studies have shown a link between CR,
  reduced mortality, and life extension.
