quotes:
- These conditions are famous mostly because a few sexologists, especially Ray Blanchard
  and Michael Bailey, speculate that they are the most common cause of transgender.
  They point to studies showing most trans women endorse autogynephilia. Most trans
  people disagree with this theory, sometimes very strongly, and accuse it of reducing
  transgender to a fetish.
- But it also confirmed other peopleâ€™s findings that many cis people also have strong
  autogenderphilia. In this dataset, autogenderphilia rates in gay cis men were equal
  to those in lesbian trans women.
