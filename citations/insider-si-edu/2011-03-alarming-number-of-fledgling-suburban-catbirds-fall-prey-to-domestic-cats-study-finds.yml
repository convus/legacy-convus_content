- The main determining factor was predation, which accounted for 79 percent of juvenile
  catbird deaths within the team’s three suburban study sites. Nearly half (47 percent)
  of the deaths were attributed to domestic cats in Opal Daniels and Spring Park.
  The deaths were either witnessed by the scientists or determined to be cat-related
  by the condition of the fledgling’s remains, such as a decapitated bird with the
  body left uneaten—defining characters of a cat kill.
