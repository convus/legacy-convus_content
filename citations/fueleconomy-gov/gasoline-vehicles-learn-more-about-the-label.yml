quotes:
- 'The annual fuel cost is based on two assumptions: an annual mileage of 15,000 miles
  and a projected gasoline price.'
- cost estimates are based on 15,000 miles per year at 3.70 per gallon
- Combined fuel economy is a weighted average of City and Highway MPG values that
  is calculated by weighting the City value by 55% and the Highway value by 45%.
