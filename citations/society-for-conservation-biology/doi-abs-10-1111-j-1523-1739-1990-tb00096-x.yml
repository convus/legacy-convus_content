- This action was opposed vociferously by animal welfare groups who were concerned
  about cruelty during the poisoning. As a young and idealistic conservationist I
  was shocked that such an important program could be halted by opponents who concluded
  they would rather allow the extinction of all 17 endangered endemics that condone
  the poisoning of rabbits. The island's condition deteriorated for 12 more years
  until 1986 when the rabbits were finally eradicated by a well-executed poisoning
  program.
