quotes:
- 'Across 13 species, only two negative associations between recreational activities
  and wildlife detections were observed at weekly scales: mountain biking on moose
  and grizzly bears.'
- However, finer‚Äêscale analysis showed that all species avoided humans on trails,
  with avoidance strongest for mountain biking and motorized vehicles.
