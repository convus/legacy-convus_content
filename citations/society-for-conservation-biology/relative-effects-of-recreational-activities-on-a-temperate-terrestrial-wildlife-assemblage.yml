quotes:
- However, finer‚Äêscale analysis showed that all species avoided humans on trails,
  with avoidance strongest for mountain biking and motorized vehicles. Our results
  imply that environmental factors generally shaped broad-scale patterns of wildlife
  use, but highlight that recreational activities also have detectable impacts.
