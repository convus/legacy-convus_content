quotes:
- You know what was fake news? Most of the Russiagate story. There was no Trump-Russia
  conspiracy, that thing we just spent three years chasing.
- Not only was there no “collusion,” the two camps didn’t even have each others’ phone
  numbers!
- More than anything, reporters should be furious at the many sources close to the
  various investigations who (it now seems clear) must have known pretty early there
  were serious holes in many areas of this story, and that a lot of these “dots” were
  dead ends, but didn’t warn their press counterparts.
