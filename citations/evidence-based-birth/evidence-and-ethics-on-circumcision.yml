quotes:
- After an extensive review of the literature, weâ€™ve concluded that there is no compelling
  evidence to justify routine male infant circumcision on medical grounds.
- The evidence from randomized trials on benefits for HIV, HPV, and HSV comes only
  from adult male circumcision in African countries. This evidence cannot be applied
  to newborn male circumcisions, nor can it be generalized to lower risk populations
  (e.g., men in countries with lower rates of female to male HIV transmission, lower
  rates of HSV, and access to the HPV vaccine)
