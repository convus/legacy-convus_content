- Along the edge of the water, in the same canal, six flags were placed, one statute
  mile from each other, and so arranged that the top of each flag was 5 feet above
  the surface. Close to the last flag in the series a longer staff was fixed, bearing
  a flag 3 feet square, and the top of which was 8 feet above the surface of the water--the
  bottom being in a line with the tops of the other and intervening flags
