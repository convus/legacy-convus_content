quotes:
- Using longitudinal data on the universe of workers in Denmark during the period
  1991-2008, we track the labor market outcomes of low-skilled natives in response
  to an exogenous inflow of low- skilled immigrants.
- We find that an increase in the supply of refugee-country immigrants pushed less
  educated native workers (especially the young and low-tenured ones) to pursue less
  manual-intensive occupations. As a result immigration had positive effects on native
  unskilled wages, employment, and occupational mobility.
