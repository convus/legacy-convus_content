quotes:
- Results confirmed that boys in 2000 were significantly more likely than those in
  1980 to report being charged with a crime.
- These findings provide evidence of a general trend toward more punitive treatment
  of boys in the juvenile justice system, especially racial and ethnic minority boys.
- Consideration of interaction effects revealed these effects were magnified for Black
  and Hispanic males.
