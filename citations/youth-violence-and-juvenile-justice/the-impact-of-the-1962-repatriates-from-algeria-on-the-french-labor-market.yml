quotes:
- This paper uses census data to examine the impact on the French labor market of
  the 900,000 people repatriated from Algeria in 1962. Repatriates settled in regions
  culturally and climatically similar to Algeria, and represented 1.6% of the total
  French labor force in 1968
- Estimates indicate that the repatriates increased the 1968 unemployment of non-repatriates
  by at most 0.3 percentage points. Average annual salaries were lower by at most
  1.3% in 1967 due to their arrival
