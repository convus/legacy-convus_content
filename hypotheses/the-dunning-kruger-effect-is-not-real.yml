  - 'In Dr. Nuhfer’s own papers, which used both computer-generated data and results
    from actual people undergoing a science literacy test, his team disproved the
    claim that most people that are unskilled are unaware of it (“a small number are:
    we saw about 5-6% that fit that in our data”) and instead showed that both experts
    and novices underestimate and overestimate their skills with the same frequency.
    “It’s just that experts do that over a narrower range,” he wrote to me.'

  quotes:
  - Much of the current consensus about peoples' inability to self-assess accurately
    comes from interpreting normative data presented in the Kruger-Dunning type graphical
    format or closely related (y - x) vs. (x) graphical conventions. Our data show
    that peoples' self-assessments of competence, in general, reflect a genuine competence
    that they can demonstrate.
