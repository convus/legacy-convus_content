    text: "The sensors maintained and used by the US government are very accurate,
      however there aren't as many of them. Private, lower-cost air quality monitors
      can help fill in the gap:\r\n\r\n> Broadly put, PurpleAir provides more localized,
      more current and less accurate readings than AirNow.\r\n"
