  quotes:
  - 'Journal impact factors depend on the research field: high impact factors are
    likely in journals covering large areas of basic research with a rapidly expanding
    but short lived literature that use many references per article'
  - 'the journal cannot in any way be taken as representative of the article. Even
    if it could, the journal impact factor would still be far from being a quality
    indicator: citation impact is primarily a measure of scientific utility rather
    than of scientific quality, and authorsâ€™ selection of references is subject to
    strong biases unrelated to quality. For evaluation of scientific quality, there
    seems to be no alternative to qualified experts reading the publications.'

  quotes:
  - Impact Factor is not a perfect tool to measure the quality of articles but there
    is nothing better and it has the advantage of already being in existence and is,
    therefore, a good technique for scientific evaluation.
