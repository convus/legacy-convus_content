## Explanation 1

Despite years spent talking about Trump's alleged collusion with Russia, no evidence was found:

> Not only was there no “collusion,” the two camps didn’t even have each others’ phone numbers!

People close to the story should have shared the lack of evidence prior to its reporting

> More than anything, reporters should be furious at the many sources close to the various investigations who (it now seems clear) must have known pretty early there were serious holes in many areas of this story, and that a lot of these “dots” were dead ends, but didn’t warn their press counterparts.
