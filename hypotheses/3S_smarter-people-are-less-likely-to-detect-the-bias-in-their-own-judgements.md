  quotes:
  - If anything, a larger bias blind spot was associated with higher cognitive ability
  - None of these bias blind spots were attenuated by measures of cognitive sophistication
    such as cognitive ability or thinking dispositions related to bias
  - Being free of the bias blind spot does not help a person avoid the actual classic
    cognitive biases.

    text: "> The so-called bias blind spot arises when people report that thinking
      biases are more prevalent in others than in themselves\r\n\r\nCognitive bias
      is correlated with intelligence\r\n\r\n> If anything, a larger bias blind spot
      was associated with higher cognitive ability\r\n"
