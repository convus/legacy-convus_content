  - The flaw in the argument that an influx of workers will adversely affect native
    workers is in looking at people as if they are bananas, Clemens says. When the
    supply of bananas increases, the value of each individual banana falls. That isn't
    the case with humans, Clemens says, whose research shows that as more people arrive
    in a local economy, demand for goods and services such as housing and food also
    increases.

  - This method improves on previous studies by choosing a control group of cities that best matches Miamiâ€™s labor market trends pre-Boatlift and providing more reliable inference. Using a sample of non-Cuban high-school dropouts we find no significant difference in the wages of workers in Miami relative to its control after 1980. We also show that by focusing on small sub-samples and matching the control group on a short pre-1979 series, as done in Borjas (2017), one can find large wage differences between Miami and control because of large measurement error.

  - when measured over a period of more than 10 years, the impact of immigration on the wages of natives overall is very small

  - This paper uses census data to examine the impact on the French labor market of the 900,000 people repatriated from Algeria in 1962. Repatriates settled in regions culturally and climatically similar to Algeria, and represented 1.6% of the total French labor force in 1968
  - Estimates indicate that the repatriates increased the 1968 unemployment of non-repatriates by at most 0.3 percentage points. Average annual salaries were lower by at most 1.3% in 1967 due to their arrival

  -  I exploit exogenous variation in European immigration to US cities between 1910 and 1930 induced by World War I and the Immigration Acts of the 1920s, and instrument immigrants' location decision relying on pre-existing settlement patterns.  Immigration increased natives' employment and occupational standing, and fostered industrial production and capital utilization.

  quotes:
  - Using longitudinal data on the universe of workers in Denmark during the period 1991-2008, we track the labor market outcomes of low-skilled natives in response to an exogenous inflow of low- skilled immigrants. 
  - We find that an increase in the supply of refugee-country immigrants pushed less educated native workers (especially the young and low-tenured ones) to pursue less manual-intensive occupations. As a result immigration had positive effects on native unskilled wages, employment, and occupational mobility.
