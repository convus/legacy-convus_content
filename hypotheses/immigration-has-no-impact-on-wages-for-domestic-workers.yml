  - This article brings a new perspective to the analysis of the wage effects of the
    Mariel boatlift crisis, in which an estimated 125,000 Cuban refugees migrated
    to Florida between April and October, 1980. The author revisits the question of
    wage impacts from such a supply shock
  - Given that at least 60% of the Marielitos were high school dropouts, this article
    specifically examines the wage impact for this low-skill group. This analysis
    over- turns the prior finding that the Mariel boatlift did not affect Miami’s
    wage structure. The wage of high school dropouts in Miami dropped dramatically,
    by 10 to 30%

  quotes:
  - The flaw in the argument that an influx of workers will adversely affect native
    workers is in looking at people as if they are bananas, Clemens says. When the
    supply of bananas increases, the value of each individual banana falls. That isn't
    the case with humans, Clemens says, whose research shows that as more people arrive
    in a local economy, demand for goods and services such as housing and food also
    increases.

  quotes:
  - This method improves on previous studies by choosing a control group of cities that best matches Miami’s labor market trends pre-Boatlift and providing more reliable inference. Using a sample of non-Cuban high-school dropouts we find no significant difference in the wages of workers in Miami relative to its control after 1980. We also show that by focusing on small sub-samples and matching the control group on a short pre-1979 series, as done in Borjas (2017), one can find large wage differences between Miami and control because of large measurement error.
