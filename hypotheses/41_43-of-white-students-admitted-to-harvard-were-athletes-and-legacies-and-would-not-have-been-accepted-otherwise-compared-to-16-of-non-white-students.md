## Explanation 1

White admits are disproportionately admitted to Harvard by non-standard admission criteria:

> the preferences Harvard gives for recruited athletes, legacies, those on the deanâ€™s interest list, and children of faculty and staff (ALDCs). Among white admits, over 43% are ALDC. Among admits who are African American, Asian American, and Hispanic, the share is less than 16% each. Our model of admissions shows that roughly three quarters of white ALDC admits would have been rejected if they had been treated as white non-ALDCs.

Removing the non-standard admission options would decrease the number of white students admitted:

> Removing preferences for athletes and legacies would significantly alter the racial distribution of admitted students, with the share of white admits falling and all other groups rising or remaining unchanged.
