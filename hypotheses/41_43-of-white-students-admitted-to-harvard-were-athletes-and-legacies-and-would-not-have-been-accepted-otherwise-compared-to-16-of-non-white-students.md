  not have been accepted otherwise (compared to 16% of non-white students)

  quotes:
  - the preferences Harvard gives for recruited athletes, legacies, those on the dean’s
    interest list, and children of faculty and staff (ALDCs). Among white admits,
    over 43% are ALDC
  - Among admits who are African American, Asian American, and Hispanic, the share
    is less than 16% each.
  - Our model of admissions shows that roughly three quarters of white ALDC admits
    would have been rejected if they had been treated as white non-ALDCs.
  - Removing preferences for athletes and legacies would significantly alter the racial
    distribution of admitted students, with the share of white admits falling and
    all other groups rising or remaining unchanged.

    text: "White admits are disproportionately admitted to Harvard by non-standard
      admission criteria:\r\n\r\n> the preferences Harvard gives for recruited athletes,
      legacies, those on the dean’s interest list, and children of faculty and staff
      (ALDCs). Among white admits, over 43% are ALDC. Among admits who are African

      model of admissions shows that roughly three quarters of white ALDC admits would
      have been rejected if they had been treated as white non-ALDCs.\r\n\r\nRemoving
      the non-standard admission options would decrease the number of white students
      admitted:\r\n\r\n> Removing preferences for athletes and legacies would significantly
      alter the racial distribution of admitted students, with the share of white
