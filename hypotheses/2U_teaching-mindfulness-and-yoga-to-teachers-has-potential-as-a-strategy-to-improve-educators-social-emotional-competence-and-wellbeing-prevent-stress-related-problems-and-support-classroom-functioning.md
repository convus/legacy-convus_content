    text: "> A wide body of research has demonstrated that contemplative practices
      can support many aspects of health and wellbeing. Contemplative interventions
      (CIs) take many forms, but most research has centered on training in mindfulness,
      mostly through Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction\r\n\r\nTeaching is a stressful
      occupation that is improved with greater emotional intelligence, mindfulness
      is a natural fit,\r\n\r\n> Recent studies have begun to demonstrate that contemplative
      interventions are a promising and feasible strategy to prevent and mitigate
      the effects of educatorsâ€™ stress and to promote mindfulness in the classroom."
