  quotes:
  - On the dawn of repeal, the late Senator Paul Wellstone made an impassioned plea
    on the Senate floor. He said the repeal of Glass-Steagall would enable the creation
    of financial conglomerates which would be too big to fail. Furthermore, he believed
    that the regulatory structure would not be able to monitor the activities of these
    financial conglomerates and they would eventually fail due to engaging in excessively
    risky financial transactions. Ultimately, he said, prophetically, that the taxpayers
    would be forced to bail out these too-big-to fail financial institutions
