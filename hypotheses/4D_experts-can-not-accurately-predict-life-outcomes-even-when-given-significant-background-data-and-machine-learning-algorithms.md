## Explanation 1

Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study is a study of 4,898 children:

> Baseline data collection ran from 1998 to 2000, with interviews with both biological parents shortly after children's births. Follow-up interviews were conducted when the children were one, three, five, nine, and fifteen years old.

Using data from the study (such as GPA and eviction and primary caregiver layoff), teams of researchers competed to create models that would accurately predict outcomes of children. The data that was not yet publicly available was used  for evaluation.

> 160 teams built predictive models for six life outcomes using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a high-quality birth cohort study.

Despite having abundant data and using sophisticated modeling tools like machine learning, no team created a model that could accurately predict outcomes:

> For all outcomes, the distance between the most divergent submissions was less than the distance between the best submission and the truth

There is a widespread belief that we can predict outcomes given enough data, but so far that remains false.

> Policymakers using predictive models in settings such as criminal justice and child-protective services should be concerned by these results. In addition to the many serious legal and ethical questions raised by using predictive models for decision-making, the results of the Fragile Families Challenge raise questions about the absolute level of predictive performance that is possible for some life outcomes, even with a rich dataset.
