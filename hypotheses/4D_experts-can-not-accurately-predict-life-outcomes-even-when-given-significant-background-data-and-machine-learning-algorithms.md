  quotes:
  - Hundreds of researchers attempted to predict six life outcomes, such as a child’s
    grade point average and whether a family would be evicted from their home. These
    researchers used machine-learning methods optimized for prediction, and they drew
    on a vast dataset that was painstakingly collected by social scientists over 15
    y. However, no one made very accurate predictions. For policymakers considering
    using predictive models in settings such as criminal justice and child-protective
    services, these results raise a number of concerns.
  - 160 teams built predictive models for six life outcomes using data from the Fragile
    Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a high-quality birth cohort study.
  - For all outcomes, the distance between the most divergent submissions was less
    than the distance between the best submission and the truth
  - Social scientists studying the life course must find a way to reconcile a widespread
    belief that understanding has been generated by these data—as demonstrated by
    more than 750 published journal articles using the Fragile Families data (10)—with
    the fact that the very same data could not yield accurate predictions of these
    important outcomes.

    text: "Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study is a study of 4,898 children:\r\n\r\n>
      Baseline data collection ran from 1998 to 2000, with interviews with both biological
      parents shortly after children's births. Follow-up interviews were conducted
      when the children were one, three, five, nine, and fifteen years old.\r\n\r\nUsing
      data from the study (such as GPA and eviction and primary caregiver layoff),
      teams of researchers competed to create models that would accurately predict
      outcomes of children. The data that was not yet publicly available was used
      \ for evaluation.\r\n\r\n> 160 teams built predictive models for six life outcomes
      using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a high-quality
      birth cohort study.\r\n\r\nDespite having abundant data and using sophisticated
      modeling tools like machine learning, no team created a model that could accurately
      predict outcomes:\r\n\r\n> For all outcomes, the distance between the most divergent
      submissions was less than the distance between the best submission and the truth\r\n\r\nThere
      is a widespread belief that we can predict outcomes given enough data, but so
      far that remains false.\r\n\r\n> Policymakers using predictive models in settings
      such as criminal justice and child-protective services should be concerned by
      these results. In addition to the many serious legal and ethical questions raised
      by using predictive models for decision-making, the results of the Fragile Families
      Challenge raise questions about the absolute level of predictive performance
      that is possible for some life outcomes, even with a rich dataset.\r\n"
