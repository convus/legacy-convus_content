  - 'We show that PanSeer detects five common types of cancer in 88% (95% CI: 80–93%)
    of post-diagnosis patients with a specificity of 96% (95% CI: 93–98%), We also
    demonstrate that PanSeer detects cancer in 95% (95% CI: 89–98%) of asymptomatic
    individuals who were later diagnosed, though future longitudinal studies are required
    to confirm this result. These results demonstrate that cancer can be non-invasively
    detected up to four years before current standard of care.'
