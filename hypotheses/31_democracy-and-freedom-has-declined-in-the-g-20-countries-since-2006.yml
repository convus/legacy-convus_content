    text: "> Between 1974 and 2005, a majority of states became democratic for the
      first time in history. However, a global democratic recession began in 2006
      and has persisted – and deepened – over the past 14 years. Not only have average
      levels of freedom (or democratic quality) been declining globally and in most
      parts of the world, but the pace of democratic breakdown accelerated and the
      number of democratic transitions declined, particularly in the past five years.
      Democratic regression is particularly visible among the G-20 countries and other
      most populous and geopolitically weighty countries, 19 of which have declined
      in freedom during the democratic recession, with only two improving. "
