  quotes:
  - Justice Thomas criticized the doctrine for bearing little resemblance to the common
    law at the time the Civil Rights Act of 1871 became law, and for being defined
    by “precisely the sort of ‘free- wheeling policy choice[s]’ that we have previously
    disclaimed the power to make.” Indeed, Justice Thomas recommended that “[i]n an
    appropriate case, we should reconsider our qualified immunity jurisprudence.”
  - But Justices have been raising questions about qualified immunity for decades.
  - In 2015, and again in 2018, Justice Sotomayor expressed concern that the Court’s
    qualified immunity decisions contribute to a culture of police violence.
  - Research examining contemporary civil rights litigation against state and local
    law enforcement shows that qualified immunity also fails to achieve its intended
    policy aims. Qualified immunity does not shield individual officers from financial
    liability. It almost never shields government officials from costs and burdens
    associated with discovery and trial in filed cases. And it appears unnecessary
    to encourage vigorous enforcement of the law.
  - Multiple studies have found that law enforcement officers infrequently think about
    the threat of being sued when performing their jobs. Notably, many of these same
    studies found that a substantial percentage of officers believe lawsuits deter
    unlawful behavior and believe that officers should be subject to civil liability.
  - Similarly, a recent survey found that a major- ity of officers believe recent
    high-profile shootings of Black men—not civil suits or the threat of liability—have
    made their job harder and discouraged them from stopping and questioning people
    they consider suspicious.
  - Finally, assuming for the sake of argument that the threat of liability deters
    officers, it is far from clear that qualified immunity could mitigate those deterrent
    effects.
