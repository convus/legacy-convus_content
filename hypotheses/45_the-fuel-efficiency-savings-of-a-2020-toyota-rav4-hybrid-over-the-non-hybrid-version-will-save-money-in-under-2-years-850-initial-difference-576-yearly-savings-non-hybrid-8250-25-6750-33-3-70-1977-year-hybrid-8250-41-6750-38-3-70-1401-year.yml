title: "The fuel efficiency savings of a 2020 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid, over the non-hybrid
  version, will save money in under 2 years"

  quotes:
  - The RAV4’s base MSRP is around $2,250 lower than that of the hybrid, but the difference
    is only $850 if you get the nonhybrid version with all-wheel drive, which comes
    standard in the hybrid version. Given the discrepancy in fuel economy between
    the two SUVs (25/33 mpg for the all-wheel-drive nonhybrid RAV4 versus 41/38 mpg
    for the hybrid), it would take the average driver a little more than two years
    to make up the difference in cost.
  - We named the RAV4 Hybrid our 2020 Best Car for the Money in the hybrid and electric
    SUV class.

  quotes:
  - 'The annual fuel cost is based on two assumptions: an annual mileage of 15,000
    miles and a projected gasoline price.'
  - cost estimates are based on 15,000 miles per year at 3.70 per gallon
  - Combined fuel economy is a weighted average of City and Highway MPG values that
    is calculated by weighting the City value by 55% and the Highway value by 45%.

      annual cost,\r\n\r\n> The annual fuel cost is based on two assumptions: an annual
      mileage of 15,000 miles and a projected gasoline price.\r\n\r\nWhich is based
      on:\r\n\r\n> cost estimates are based on 15,000 miles per year at 3.70 per gallon\r\n\r\nFed
      into an equation:\r\n\r\n>  Combined fuel economy is a weighted average of City
      and Highway MPG values that is calculated by weighting the City value by 55%
      and the Highway value by 45%.\r\n\r\nSo the cost calculation:\r\n\r\n**Non-hybrid:**
      ((8250/25)+(6750/33)) * 3.70 = $1977/year\r\n\r\n**Hybrid:** ((8250/41)+(6750/38))
      * 3.70 = $1401/year\r\n\r\nWhich is an $850 initial difference with $576 yearly
      savings."
