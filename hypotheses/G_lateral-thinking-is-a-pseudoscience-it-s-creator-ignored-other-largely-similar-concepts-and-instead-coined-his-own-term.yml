    text: "According to Wikipedia,\r\n\r\n> Lateral thinking is a manner of solving
      problems using an indirect and creative approach via reasoning that is not immediately
      obvious. It involves ideas that may not be obtainable using only traditional
      step-by-step logic. Considered pseudo-science by some\r\n\r\nIts definition
      is specific and instead is based on whatever it's creator, Edward de Bono, felt
      was applicable:\r\n\r\n> For readers who were wondering what science lateral
      thinking was based upon, de Bono’s book The Mechanism of Mind (1969) left the
      matter unresolved"
