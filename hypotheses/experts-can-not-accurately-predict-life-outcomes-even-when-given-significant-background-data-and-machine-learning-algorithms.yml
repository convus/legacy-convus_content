  quotes:
  - Hundreds of researchers attempted to predict six life outcomes, such as a child’s
    grade point average and whether a family would be evicted from their home. These
    researchers used machine-learning methods optimized for prediction, and they drew
    on a vast dataset that was painstakingly collected by social scientists over 15
    y. However, no one made very accurate predictions. For policymakers considering
    using predictive models in settings such as criminal justice and child-protective
    services, these results raise a number of concerns.
  - 160 teams built predictive models for six life outcomes using data from the Fragile
    Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a high-quality birth cohort study.
  - For all outcomes, the distance between the most divergent submissions was less
    than the distance between the best submission and the truth
  - Social scientists studying the life course must find a way to reconcile a widespread
    belief that understanding has been generated by these data—as demonstrated by
    more than 750 published journal articles using the Fragile Families data (10)—with
    the fact that the very same data could not yield accurate predictions of these
    important outcomes.
