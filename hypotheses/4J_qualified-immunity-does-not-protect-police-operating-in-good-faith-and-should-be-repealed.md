## Explanation 1

Qualified immunity appears to contribute to a culture of police violence,

> In 2015, and again in 2018, Justice Sotomayor expressed concern that the Court’s qualified immunity decisions contribute to a culture of police violence.

It doesn't achieve it's stated aim:

> Research examining contemporary civil rights litigation against state and local law enforcement shows that qualified immunity also fails to achieve its intended policy aims. Qualified immunity does not shield individual officers from financial liability. It almost never shields government officials from costs and burdens associated with discovery and trial in filed cases. And it appears unnecessary to encourage vigorous enforcement of the law.

Partly because, concern about liability doesn't dramatically effect police behavior:

> Multiple studies have found that law enforcement officers infrequently think about the threat of being sued when performing their jobs. Notably, many of these same studies found that a substantial percentage of officers believe lawsuits deter unlawful behavior and believe that officers should be subject to civil liability.

The larger impact on behavior is bad PR for police.

> Similarly, a recent survey found that a majority of officers believe recent high-profile shootings of Black men—not civil suits or the threat of liability—have made their job harder and discouraged them from stopping and questioning people they consider suspicious.
> ref:https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4796&context=ndlr

And if liability was the thing that altered police behavior, qualified immunity wouldn't necessarily mitigate it:

> Finally, assuming for the sake of argument that the threat of liability deters officers, it is far from clear that qualified immunity could mitigate those deterrent effects.
