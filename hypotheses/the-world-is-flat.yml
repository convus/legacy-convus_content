  quotes:
  - Along the edge of the water, in the same canal, six flags were placed, one statute
    mile from each other, and so arranged that the top of each flag was 5 feet above
    the surface. Close to the last flag in the series a longer staff was fixed, bearing
    a flag 3 feet square, and the top of which was 8 feet above the surface of the
    water--the bottom being in a line with the tops of the other and intervening flags
