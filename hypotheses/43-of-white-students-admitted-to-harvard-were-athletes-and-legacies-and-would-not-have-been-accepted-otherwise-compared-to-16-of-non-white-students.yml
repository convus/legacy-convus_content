  quotes:
  - the preferences Harvard gives for recruited athletes, legacies, those on the deanâ€™s
    interest list, and children of faculty and staff (ALDCs). Among white admits,
    over 43% are ALDC
  - Among admits who are African American, Asian American, and Hispanic, the share
    is less than 16% each.
  - Our model of admissions shows that roughly three quarters of white ALDC admits
    would have been rejected if they had been treated as white non-ALDCs.
  - Removing preferences for athletes and legacies would significantly alter the racial
    distribution of admitted students, with the share of white admits falling and
    all other groups rising or remaining unchanged.
