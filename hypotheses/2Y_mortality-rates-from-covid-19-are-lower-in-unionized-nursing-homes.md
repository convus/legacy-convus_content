    text: "> Health care worker unions were associated with a 1.29-percentagepoint
      reduction in mortality, which represents a 30 percent relative decrease in the
      COVID-19 mortality rate compared with facilities without these unions. Unions
      were also associated with greater access to PPE, one mechanism that may link
      unions to lower COVID-19 mortality rates.\r\n\r\nThis is important because nursing
      homes are a source of a lot of COVID-19 deaths:\r\n\r\n> More than 40 percent
      of all reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths in the United States
      have occurred in nursing homes."
