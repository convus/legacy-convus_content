## Explanation 1

> Health care worker unions were associated with a 1.29-percentagepoint reduction in mortality, which represents a 30 percent relative decrease in the COVID-19 mortality rate compared with facilities without these unions. Unions were also associated with greater access to PPE, one mechanism that may link unions to lower COVID-19 mortality rates.

This is important because nursing homes are a source of a lot of COVID-19 deaths:

> More than 40 percent of all reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths in the United States have occurred in nursing homes.
