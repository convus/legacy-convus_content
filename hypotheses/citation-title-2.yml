  quotes:
  - exposure to artificial light at night induces strong responses for physiological
    measures, daily activity patterns and life history traits.
  - We found particularly strong responses with regards to hormone levels, the onset
    of daily activity in diurnal species and life history traits, such as the number
    of offspring, predation, cognition and seafinding (in turtles).
