  quotes:
  - The Republican Party's campaign platform in the 2000 election called for "full
    implementation" of the Iraq Liberation Act and removal of Saddam Hussein; and
    key Bush advisers, including Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald
    Rumsfeld, and Rumsfeld's Deputy Paul Wolfowitz, were longstanding advocates of
    invading Iraq, and contributed to a September 2000 report from the Project for
    the New American Century that argued for using an invasion of Iraq as a means
    for the US to "play a more permanent role in Gulf regional security..."
  - The US government's belief that Iraq was developing Weapons of Mass Destruction
    (WMDs), was based upon documents which the CIA argued could not be trusted.
