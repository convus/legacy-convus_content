## Explanation 1

Transportation accounts for the largest single segment of greenhouse gas emissions:

> The transportation sector is one of the largest contributors to anthropogenic U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. According to the _Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks 1990â€“2019_ (the national inventory that the U.S. prepares annually under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), transportation accounted for the largest portion (29%) of total U.S. GHG emissions in 2019.

And of that segment, the majority comes from personal vehicles:

> 58% of the U.S. Transportation Sector GHG Emissions came from light-duty vehicles

In Carbon Costs Quantified, switching from an SUV to a generic car, and a generic car to an electric one, each provide the largest carbon impact (without requiring actual lifestyle changes - e.g. biking, moving from the suburbs to the city).

> Switch SUV to generic car: 6,600 Lbs.
> Switch generic car to Tesla: 6,750 Lbs
