  quotes:
  - As a result of this tampering, more than 570,000 tons of excess oxides of nitrogen
    (NOx) and 5,000 tons of particulate matter (PM) will be emitted by these tampered
    trucks over the lifetime of the vehicles. These tampered trucks constitute approximately
    15 percent of the national population of diesel trucks that were originally certified
    with emissions controls. But, due to their severe excess NOx emissions, these
    trucks have an air quality impact equivalent to adding more than 9 million additional
    (compliant, non-tampered) diesel pickup trucks to our roads
