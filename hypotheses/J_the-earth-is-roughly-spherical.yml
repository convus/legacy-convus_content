  quotes:
  - On a flat Earth, a Sun that shines in all directions would illuminate the entire
    surface at the same time, and all places would experience sunrise and sunset at
    the horizon at about the same time. With a spherical Earth, half the planet is
    in daylight at any given time and the other half experiences nighttime. When a
    given location on the spherical Earth is in sunlight, its antipode - the location
    exactly on the opposite side of the Earth - is in darkness.
  - The Earth is massive enough that the pull of gravity maintains its roughly spherical
    shape. Most of its deviation from spherical stems from the centrifugal force caused
    by rotation around its north-south axis. This force deforms the sphere into an
    oblate ellipsoid
