Autogynephilia and Autoandrophilia (jointly autogenderphilia), becoming aroused by imagining yourself as the opposite gender, is speculated as a cause of transness,

> These conditions are famous mostly because a few sexologists, especially Ray Blanchard and Michael Bailey, speculate that they are the most common cause of transgender.
