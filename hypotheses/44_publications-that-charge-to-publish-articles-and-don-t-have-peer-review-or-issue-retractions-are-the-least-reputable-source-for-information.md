## Explanation 1

Publications masquerading as edited and peer reviewed give legitimacy to suspicious claims:

> The difference—editing and peer review—is critical: when it comes to public health, fake journals are a real danger.

Jeffrey Beall (the publisher of a prominent list of predatory journals) states,

> All journals published by a predatory publisher are potentially predatory unless stated otherwise
