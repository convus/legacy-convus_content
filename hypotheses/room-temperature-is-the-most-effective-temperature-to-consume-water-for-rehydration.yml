  quotes:
  - Water at 16°C induced higher intake (6.4 ml/ kg) together with lower sweating (0.54 ± 0.03 g), which can result in optimum level of hydration
  - Sweating increased markedly just a few minutes after the onset of drinking.
  - Drinking induces the recovery of thermoregulatory responses including sweating.
