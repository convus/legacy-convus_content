  quotes:
  - Prior ratings created significant bias in individual rating behavior, and positive
    and negative social influences created asymmetric herding effects.
  - For example, popular products may be popular because of the irrational effect
    of past positive ratings
  - Our society is increasingly relying on the digitized, aggregated opinions of others
    to make decisions.
