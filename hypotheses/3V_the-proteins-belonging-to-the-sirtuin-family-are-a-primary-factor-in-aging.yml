  quotes:
  - One of the most promising targets for anti-ageing approaches are proteins belonging
    to the sirtuin family
  - proper lifestyle including physical activity and diet can influence healthspan
    via increasing the level of sirtuins

  quotes:
  - several controversial issues around sirtuins and their functions in aging, calorie
    restriction, as well as age-related diseases
  - The controversy around sirtuins and their functions in aging has drawn in the
    past few years as much attention, if not more, from the scientific community and
    the public as they did when first proposed as the key conserved aging regulators
    in eukaryotes.
