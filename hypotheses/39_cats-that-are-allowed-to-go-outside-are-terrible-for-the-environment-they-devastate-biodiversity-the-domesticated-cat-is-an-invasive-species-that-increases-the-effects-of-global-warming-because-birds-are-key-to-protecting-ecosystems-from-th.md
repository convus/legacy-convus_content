hypothesis: Cats that are allowed to go outside are terrible for the environment;
  they devastate biodiversity. The domesticated cat is an invasive species that increases
  the effects of global warming, because birds are key to protecting ecosystems from
  the stresses of climate change

## Explanation 1

In one study, catbirds primarily died from predators, the plurality of which were cats:

> The main determining factor was predation, which accounted for 79 percent of juvenile catbird deaths within the team’s three suburban study sites. Nearly half (47 percent) of the deaths were attributed to domestic cats in Opal Daniels and Spring Park. The deaths were either witnessed by the scientists or determined to be cat-related by the condition of the fledgling’s remains, such as a decapitated bird with the body left uneaten—defining characters of a cat kill.

Birds are important for protecting from the shocks of climate change - by, for example, eating invasive insect pests:

> Excluding birds caused a greater increase in herbivorous arthropod abundance than excluding bats, leading to increased coffee leaf damage.

Rather than euthanizing feral cats, cat lovers have advocated for trapping, sterilizing and releasing (TNR) and generally prize cat life above native biodiversity:

> Cat groups are trying to reinstate TNR in Los Angeles (where it failed miserably in the past) and make it illegal to remove ferals from a wildlife refuge in South Florida, where the cats have taken a major toll on an endangered woodrat.

This is a common failure state of animal welfare groups.

> This action was opposed vociferously by animal welfare groups who were concerned about cruelty during the poisoning. As a young and idealistic conservationist I was shocked that such an important program could be halted by opponents who concluded they would rather allow the extinction of all 17 endangered endemics that condone the poisoning of rabbits. The island's condition deteriorated for 12 more years until 1986 when the rabbits were finally eradicated by a well-executed poisoning program.
