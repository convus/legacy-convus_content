## Explanation 1

> One of the most promising targets for anti-ageing approaches are proteins belonging to the sirtuin family
> ref:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5514220

They appear to be linked to lifestyle:

> proper lifestyle including physical activity and diet can influence healthspan via increasing the level of sirtuins
> ref:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5514220

However, they are not without controversy.

> The controversy around sirtuins and their functions in aging has drawn in the past few years as much attention, if not more, from the scientific community and the public as they did when first proposed as the key conserved aging regulators in eukaryotes.
