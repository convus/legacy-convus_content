title: "The fuel efficiency savings of a 2020 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid, over the non-hybrid
  version, will save money in under 2 years ($850 initial difference, $576 yearly
  savings)\r\nNon-hybrid: ((8250/25)+(6750/33)) * 3.70 = $1977/year\r\nHybrid: ((8250/41)+(6750/38))
  * 3.70 = $1401/year"

  quotes:
  - The RAV4’s base MSRP is around $2,250 lower than that of the hybrid, but the difference
    is only $850 if you get the nonhybrid version with all-wheel drive, which comes
    standard in the hybrid version. Given the discrepancy in fuel economy between
    the two SUVs (25/33 mpg for the all-wheel-drive nonhybrid RAV4 versus 41/38 mpg
    for the hybrid), it would take the average driver a little more than two years
    to make up the difference in cost.
  - We named the RAV4 Hybrid our 2020 Best Car for the Money in the hybrid and electric
    SUV class.

  quotes:
  - 'The annual fuel cost is based on two assumptions: an annual mileage of 15,000
    miles and a projected gasoline price.'
  - cost estimates are based on 15,000 miles per year at 3.70 per gallon
  - Combined fuel economy is a weighted average of City and Highway MPG values that
    is calculated by weighting the City value by 55% and the Highway value by 45%.
