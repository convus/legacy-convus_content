  quotes:
  - Results from two experiments indicate that even when people are successful at
    maintaining sustained attention—as when avoiding the temptation to check their
    phones—the mere presence of these devices reduces available cognitive capacity.
  - These cognitive costs are highest for those highest in smartphone dependence.

      phones—the mere presence of these devices reduces available cognitive capacity.\r\n\r\nFittingly,
      people who depend on their phones more are most heavily effected,\r\n\r\n> These
      cognitive costs are highest for those highest in smartphone dependence.\r\n\r\n"
