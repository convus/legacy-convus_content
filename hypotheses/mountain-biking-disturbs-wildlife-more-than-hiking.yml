  quotes:
  - 'Across 13 species, only two negative associations between recreational activities
    and wildlife detections were observed at weekly scales: mountain biking on moose
    and grizzly bears.'
  - However, finer‚Äêscale analysis showed that all species avoided humans on trails,
    with avoidance strongest for mountain biking and motorized vehicles.
