      The capacity of any type of battery will diminish after a certain amount of
      recharging. With lithium-ion batteries, the capacity diminishes slightly with
      each complete charge cycle.\r\n\r\nBy plugging in your battery powered device,
      you prevent it from undergoing charge cycles - and therefor increase its battery
      lifespan."
