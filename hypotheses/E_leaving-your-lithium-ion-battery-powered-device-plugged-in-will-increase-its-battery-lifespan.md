## Explanation 1

Every time you recharge a battery, the battery loses some of its capacity.

> The capacity of any type of battery will diminish after a certain amount of recharging. With lithium-ion batteries, the capacity diminishes slightly with each complete charge cycle.

By plugging in your battery powered device, you prevent it from undergoing charge cycles - and therefor increase its battery lifespan.
