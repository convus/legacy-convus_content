    text: " Autogynephilia and Autoandrophilia (jointly autogenderphilia), becoming
      aroused by imagining yourself as the opposite gender, is speculated as a cause
      of transness,\r\n\r\n> These conditions are famous mostly because a few sexologists,
      especially Ray Blanchard and Michael Bailey, speculate that they are the most
      common cause of transgender. They point to studies showing most trans women
      endorse autogynephilia. Most trans people disagree with this theory, sometimes
      very strongly, and accuse it of reducing transgender to a fetish.\r\n\r\nBut
      survey responses make it clear that trans people aren't the only ones who experience
      autogenderphilia:\r\n\r\n> But it also confirmed other peopleâ€™s findings that
      many cis people also have strong autogenderphilia. In this dataset, autogenderphilia
      rates in gay cis men were equal to those in lesbian trans women."
