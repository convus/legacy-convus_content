  from a publication

  quotes:
  - 'Journal impact factors depend on the research field: high impact factors are
    likely in journals covering large areas of basic research with a rapidly expanding
    but short lived literature that use many references per article'
  - 'the journal cannot in any way be taken as representative of the article. Even
    if it could, the journal impact factor would still be far from being a quality
    indicator: citation impact is primarily a measure of scientific utility rather
    than of scientific quality, and authors’ selection of references is subject to
    strong biases unrelated to quality. For evaluation of scientific quality, there
    seems to be no alternative to qualified experts reading the publications.'

  quotes:
  - It is frequently used as a proxy for the relative importance of a journal within
    its field; journals with higher impact factors are often deemed to be more important
    than those with lower ones.
  - Journal impact factors are often used to evaluate the merit of individual articles
    and individual researchers.
  - Empirical evidence shows that the misuse of the JIF – and journal ranking metrics
    in general – has a number of negative consequences for the scholarly communication
    system. These include confusion between outreach of a journal and the quality
    of individual papers and insufficient coverage of social sciences and humanities
    as well as research outputs from across Latin America, Africa, and South-East
    Asia.
