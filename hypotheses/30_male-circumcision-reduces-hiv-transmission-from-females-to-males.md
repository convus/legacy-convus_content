    text: "> After an extensive review of the literature, weâ€™ve concluded that there
      is no compelling evidence to justify routine male infant circumcision on medical
      grounds.\r\n\r\nThe evidence in favor of circumcision is from populations at
      high risk of STDs, people at lower risk should more heavily weigh the drawbacks
      to circumcision - which are not adequately studied.\r\n\r\n> The evidence from
      randomized trials on benefits for HIV, HPV, and HSV comes only from adult male
      circumcision in African countries. This evidence cannot be applied to newborn
      male circumcisions, nor can it be generalized to lower risk populations (e.g.,
      men in countries with lower rates of female to male HIV transmission, lower
      rates of HSV, and access to the HPV vaccine)"
