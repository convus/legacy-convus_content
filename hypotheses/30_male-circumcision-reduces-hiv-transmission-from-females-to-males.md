## Explanation 1

> Since the 1980s, over 30 observational studies have suggested a protective effect of male circumcision on HIV acquisition in heterosexual men

## Explanation 2

> After an extensive review of the literature, weâ€™ve concluded that there is no compelling evidence to justify routine male infant circumcision on medical grounds.

The evidence in favor of circumcision is from populations at high risk of STDs, people at lower risk should more heavily weigh the drawbacks to circumcision - which are not adequately studied.

> The evidence from randomized trials on benefits for HIV, HPV, and HSV comes only from adult male circumcision in African countries. This evidence cannot be applied to newborn male circumcisions, nor can it be generalized to lower risk populations (e.g., men in countries with lower rates of female to male HIV transmission, lower rates of HSV, and access to the HPV vaccine)
