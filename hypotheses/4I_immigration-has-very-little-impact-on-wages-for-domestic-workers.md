## Explanation 1

In general, immigration doesn't have a big impact on native wages:

> when measured over a period of more than 10 years, the impact of immigration on the wages of natives overall is very small
> ref:https://www.nap.edu/catalog/23550/the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration

Unlike supply and demand of goods, where adding items lowers the value of each item, additional humans _increase_ the demand for goods, increasing the number of jobs.

> research shows that as more people arrive in a local economy, demand for goods and services such as housing and food also increases.

Immigrants have a positive impact on natives' employment and wages.

> I exploit exogenous variation in European immigration to US cities between 1910 and 1930 induced by World War I and the Immigration Acts of the 1920s, and instrument immigrants' location decision relying on pre-existing settlement patterns. Immigration increased natives' employment and occupational standing, and fostered industrial production and capital utilization.
> ref:https://economics.mit.edu/files/13646

The immigrants led to a positive effect on low skill workers:

> We find that an increase in the supply of refugee-country immigrants pushed less educated native workers (especially the young and low-tenured ones) to pursue less manual-intensive occupations. As a result immigration had positive effects on native unskilled wages, employment, and occupational mobility.
