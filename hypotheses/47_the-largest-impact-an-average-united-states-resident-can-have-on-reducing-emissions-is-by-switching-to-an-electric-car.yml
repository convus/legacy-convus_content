    text: "Transportation accounts for the largest single segment of greenhouse gas
      emissions:\r\n\r\n> The transportation sector is one of the largest contributors
      to anthropogenic U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. According to the _Inventory
      of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks 1990â€“2019_ (the national inventory
      that the U.S. prepares annually under the United Nations Framework Convention
      on Climate Change), transportation accounted for the largest portion (29%) of
      total U.S. GHG emissions in 2019. \r\n\r\nAnd of that segment, the majority
      comes from personal vehicles:\r\n\r\n> 58% of the U.S. Transportation Sector
      GHG Emissions came from light-duty vehicles\r\n\r\nIn Carbon Costs Quantified,
      switching from an SUV to a generic car, and a generic car to an electric one,
      each provide the largest carbon impact (without requiring actual lifestyle changes
      - e.g. biking, moving from the suburbs to the city).\r\n\r\n> Switch SUV to
      generic car: 6,600 Lbs.\r\n> Switch generic car to Tesla: 6,750 Lbs\r\n\r\n"
