## Explanation 1

Temperature regulation is aided by drinking,

> Drinking induces the recovery of thermoregulatory responses including sweating.
> ref:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3762624/pdf/ijcem0006-0683.pdf

Because sweating is increased by drinking,

> Sweating increased markedly just a few minutes after the onset of drinking.
> ref:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3762624/pdf/ijcem0006-0683.pdf

Room temperature water makes optimal hydration more likely:

> Water at 16°C induced higher intake (6.4 ml/ kg) together with lower sweating (0.54 ± 0.03 g), which can result in optimum level of hydration
