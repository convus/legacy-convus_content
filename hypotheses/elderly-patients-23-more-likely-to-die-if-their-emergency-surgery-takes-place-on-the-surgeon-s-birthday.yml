  - Patient characteristics, including severity of illness, were similar between patients
    who underwent surgery on a surgeon’s birthday and those who underwent surgery
    on other days. The overall unadjusted 30 day mortality on the operating surgeon’s
    birthday was 7.0% (145/2,064) and that on other days was 5.6% (54,824/978,812)
