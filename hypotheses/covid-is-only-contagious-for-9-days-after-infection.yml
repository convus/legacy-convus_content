  - Maximum shedding duration was 83 days in the upper respiratory tract, 59 days
    in the lower respiratory tract, 126 days in stools, and 60 days in serum. Pooled
    mean SARS-CoV-2 shedding duration was positively associated with age (slope 0·304
    [95% CI 0·115–0·493]; p=0·0016).  No study detected live virus beyond day 9 of
    illness, despite persistently high viral loads
