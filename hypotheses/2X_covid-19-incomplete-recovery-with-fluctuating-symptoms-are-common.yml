    text: "Long COVID has been observed since early in the pandemic, and is gaining
      increasing visibility\r\n\r\n> Eight months into the global pandemic, we’re
      still measuring its effects only in deaths. Non-hospitalized cases are loosely
      termed ‘mild’ and are not followed up.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the increase of Long
      COVID patients could shed light on other long term illnesses, such as Lyme.\r\n\r\n>
      Some patients could be living with the aftereffects for years to come. Recent
      research into another persistent, mysterious disease might help us understand
      how to treat them."
