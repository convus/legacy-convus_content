    text: "Charging at high temperatures results in damaging batteries\r\n\r\n> It’s
      especially important to avoid exposing your device to ambient temperatures higher
      than 95° F (35° C), which can permanently damage battery capacity. That is,
      your battery won’t power your device as long on a given charge. Charging the
      device in high ambient temperatures can damage it further."
