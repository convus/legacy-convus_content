## Explanation 1

Before being elected, Bush and his advisers intended to remove Saddam:

> The Republican Party's campaign platform in the 2000 election called for "full implementation" of the Iraq Liberation Act and removal of Saddam Hussein; and key Bush advisers, including Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and Rumsfeld's Deputy Paul Wolfowitz, were longstanding advocates of invading Iraq, and contributed to a September 2000 report from the Project for the New American Century that argued for using an invasion of Iraq as a means for the US to "play a more permanent role in Gulf regional security".

The documents that served as a basis for WMD were never trustworthy:

> The US government's belief that Iraq was developing Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs), was based upon documents which the CIA argued could not be trusted.
