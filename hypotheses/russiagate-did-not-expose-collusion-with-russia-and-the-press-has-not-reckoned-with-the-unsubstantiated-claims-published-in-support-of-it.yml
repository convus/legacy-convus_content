  quotes:
  - You know what was fake news? Most of the Russiagate story. There was no Trump-Russia
    conspiracy, that thing we just spent three years chasing.
  - Not only was there no “collusion,” the two camps didn’t even have each others’
    phone numbers!
  - More than anything, reporters should be furious at the many sources close to the
    various investigations who (it now seems clear) must have known pretty early there
    were serious holes in many areas of this story, and that a lot of these “dots”
    were dead ends, but didn’t warn their press counterparts.

- Russiagate
