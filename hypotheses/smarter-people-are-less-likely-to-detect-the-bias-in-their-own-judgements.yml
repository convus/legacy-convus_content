  quotes:
  - If anything, a larger bias blind spot was associated with higher cognitive ability
  - None of these bias blind spots were attenuated by measures of cognitive sophistication
    such as cognitive ability or thinking dispositions related to bias
  - Being free of the bias blind spot does not help a person avoid the actual classic
    cognitive biases.
