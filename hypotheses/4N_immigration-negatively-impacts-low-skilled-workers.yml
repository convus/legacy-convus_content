  - This method improves on previous studies by choosing a control group of cities
    that best matches Miami’s labor market trends pre-Boatlift and providing more
    reliable inference. Using a sample of non-Cuban high-school dropouts we find no
    significant difference in the wages of workers in Miami relative to its control
    after 1980. We also show that by focusing on small sub-samples and matching the
    control group on a short pre-1979 series, as done in Borjas (2017), one can find
    large wage differences between Miami and control because of large measurement
    error.

  quotes:
  - This article brings a new perspective to the analysis of the wage effects of the
    Mariel boatlift crisis, in which an estimated 125,000 Cuban refugees migrated
    to Florida between April and October, 1980. The author revisits the question of
    wage impacts from such a supply shock
  - Given that at least 60% of the Marielitos were high school dropouts, this article
    specifically examines the wage impact for this low-skill group. This analysis
    over- turns the prior finding that the Mariel boatlift did not affect Miami’s
    wage structure. The wage of high school dropouts in Miami dropped dramatically,
    by 10 to 30%
