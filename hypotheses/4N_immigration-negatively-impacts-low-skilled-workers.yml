  - This method improves on previous studies by choosing a control group of cities
    that best matches Miami’s labor market trends pre-Boatlift and providing more
    reliable inference. Using a sample of non-Cuban high-school dropouts we find no
    significant difference in the wages of workers in Miami relative to its control
    after 1980. We also show that by focusing on small sub-samples and matching the
    control group on a short pre-1979 series, as done in Borjas (2017), one can find
    large wage differences between Miami and control because of large measurement
    error.

  quotes:
  - This article brings a new perspective to the analysis of the wage effects of the
    Mariel boatlift crisis, in which an estimated 125,000 Cuban refugees migrated
    to Florida between April and October, 1980. The author revisits the question of
    wage impacts from such a supply shock
  - Given that at least 60% of the Marielitos were high school dropouts, this article
    specifically examines the wage impact for this low-skill group. This analysis
    over- turns the prior finding that the Mariel boatlift did not affect Miami’s
    wage structure. The wage of high school dropouts in Miami dropped dramatically,
    by 10 to 30%

    text: "> The Mariel boatlift was a mass emigration of Cubans, who traveled from
      Cuba's Mariel Harbor to the United States between 15 April and 31 October 1980.\r\n\r\nBecause
      this was a dramatic and singular event, there are many studies on its effect.
      There is a general agreement that,\r\n\r\n> Aside from the unemployment rate
      rising from 5.0 percent in April 1980 to 7.1 percent in July, the actual damage
      to the economy was marginal and followed trends across the United States at
      the time.\r\n\r\nHowever, when looking specifically at low income residents,
      the immigration doesn't seem to be as neutral:\r\n\r\n> Given that at least
      60% of the Marielitos were high school dropouts, this article specifically examines
      the wage impact for this low-skill group. This analysis over- turns the prior
      finding that the Mariel boatlift did not affect Miami’s wage structure. The
      wage of high school dropouts in Miami dropped dramatically, by 10 to 30%\r\n\r\nIn
      general, this appears to be a trend, with immigration hurting low skilled workers.\r\n"
