## Explanation 1

> The RAV4â€™s base MSRP is around $2,250 lower than that of the hybrid, but the difference is only $850 if you get the nonhybrid version with all-wheel drive, which comes standard in the hybrid version. Given the discrepancy in fuel economy between the two SUVs (25/33 mpg for the all-wheel-drive nonhybrid RAV4 versus 41/38 mpg for the hybrid), it would take the average driver a little more than two years to make up the difference in cost.

To calculate the annual cost,

> The annual fuel cost is based on two assumptions: an annual mileage of 15,000 miles and a projected gasoline price.

Which is based on:

> cost estimates are based on 15,000 miles per year at 3.70 per gallon

Fed into an equation:

> Combined fuel economy is a weighted average of City and Highway MPG values that is calculated by weighting the City value by 55% and the Highway value by 45%.

So the cost calculation:

**Non-hybrid:** ((8250/25)+(6750/33)) * 3.70 = $1977/year

**Hybrid:** ((8250/41)+(6750/38)) * 3.70 = $1401/year

Which is an $850 initial difference with $576 yearly savings.
